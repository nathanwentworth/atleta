## A Hand-drawn Sailing Adventure
On the morning of her 16th birthday, Atleta woke to the familiar sounds of her village, An Tara, and the sea that it belonged to. 

Atleta is a hand-drawn sailing adventure made for Global Game Jam 2016 about a young woman coming of age by sailing to four islands and learning the truths of the sea.
